# 007 - A License To Kill Processes
1) This license is granted to user... super user.
2) Trees shall be shaken and not stirred.
3) Any process targeted for termination or placed in the kill queue must be appropriately identified by its PID.
4) Under no circumstances shall random PIDs be terminated, under penalty of rm.
5) Sandbox. Shit, I'm still in sandbox.
6) The fact this trope just shifted from cold war to vietnam is probably due to a shared library.
7) For your sins you have been granted this license and accompanying mission.
8) When a process is running amok without any boundaries for moral decency or acceptable executable conduct, the holder of this license shall terminate that process with extreme prejudice.
9) If I tell you it's safe the surf that internet, it's safe to surf the net, now what are you gonna do coder? Cuz you either surf, or code... What's it gonna be?
10) I love the smell of cold pizza and redbull in the morning. You that smell? That syrupy pepperoni smell? Smells like development. Someday, this code's gonna compile...
