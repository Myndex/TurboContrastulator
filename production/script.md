# TurboContrastulator

SHOOTING SCRPT

Hello, I'm Doctor Arnie Sarkasim, you may remember me from
such educational films as "Ethlyne Glycol: Tastes Great but Don't Drink It"
and "Our Friend Mathmatics: a friend we can count on".
Today I am here at Mynd-Wrecks Re-Search, to present to you 
an exciting innovation.

For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring
perfection to the cryptically conceived concept of contrast that would 
not only supply inverse reactive spatial quanta for use in unilateral 
phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing 
cardinal grameters. Such an algorithm is the turbo contrastulator.

Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of light 
being generated by the relative emmyssion of luminatar-fluxes, it is produced 
by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.

The original algorithm used a base formula where a pre-famulated amulite 
was surmounting a malleable logarithmic return statement, in such a way that 
the two spurving bear-rings were on a syma-trick axis with a panametric 
phantom. The latter consisted simply of a matrix of nine hydrocoptic 
marzlevanes, calculated into the ambifacient lunar wane-space such that 
cone-fumbling was effectively prevented.

The main calculation is of the normal lotus-o-delta type after a 
panendermic semi-boloid soft-clarping of the goto statement, switching 
every seventh case via non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential 
dev spring-roller on the W axis of the grameters.

And now, utilizing the latest advances in artificially flavored machine 
intelsentience, we can now say with complete confidence the order of 
opteritations to maximize the functionality, such that we can present, 
in the simplest possible manner, what we would further describe as, 
an expressed plurality of the following de-complexified planar 
linguistic tutorial.

The turbo contrastulator algorithm knows what the contrast is at all times.
It knows this because it knows what it isn’t. By subtracting what it is from
what it isn’t, or what it isn’t from what it is (whichever is greater), it
attains a difference or deviance. The turbo contrastulator algorithm uses these
deviant results to generate corrective commands to drive the contrast from a
value where it is, to a value where it isn’t, arriving at a value where it wasn’t,
but is now. Consequently, the value where it is, is the value where it wasn’t.
So it follows therefore, that the value where it was, is the value where it now isn’t. 

As you can plainly see the turbo-contrastulator has now achieved a high level 
of deployment, and it is being successfully used in the operation of 
novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor prediction is required, 
it may also be employed in conjunction with an articula-procation dingle 
armature, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.

thank you for watching.
